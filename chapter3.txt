An application programming interface (API) is code that enables two software programs to communicate. An API defines how a developer should request services from an operating system (OS) or other application, and expose data within different contexts and across multiple channels.

Any data can be shared with an application programming interface. APIs are implemented by function calls composed of verbs and nouns; the required syntax is described in the documentation of the application being called. For example, on a real estate website, one API might publish available real estate properties by geography, while a second API provides current interest rates and a third offers a mortgage calculator.

In the early days of Web 2.0, the concept of integrating data and applications from different sources was called a mashup. The web, software designed to exchange data via the internet and cloud computing have all combined to increase the interest in APIs and services.
